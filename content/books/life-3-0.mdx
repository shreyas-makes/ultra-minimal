A broad introduction to what the future of AI and general intelligence could hold for humanity, and the ethical consierations that should be taken into account as we move forward.

The thought experiment in the introduction is a cool imagination of what general intelligence could look like.

The book has become slighlty outdated with the recent developments in AI.
