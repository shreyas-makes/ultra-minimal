Seneca has one message here which is quite simple: life is short, but we make it much shorter by spending time on things that are unimportant.

Seneca contends that the pursuit of philosophy is the finest example of a time well spent. He advises us to read philosophy and ponder upon its great principles, and that, he believes will greatly enrich us.
