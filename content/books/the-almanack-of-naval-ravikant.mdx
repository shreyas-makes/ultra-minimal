I went into the book expecting another iteration of self-help or life advice books, but ended up really liking it. The author organizes all of Naval's online advice into a nice structure around achieving happiness and financial freedom in life.

One of those books which I occasionally re-read. 

"Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."

I liked how he puts in his priorities: Priorities: Naval's number one priority is his physical health. Second, it's mental health. Third, it's spiritual health. Then, it's his family's health. Then, it's his family's wellbeing. Then, it's the rest of the world.
