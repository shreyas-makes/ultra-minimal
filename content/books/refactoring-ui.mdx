A guide to UI design, written by the creators of Tailwind CSS. I was hoping for insight on the first-principles of great web design along with more tactical tips. Instead, this book focuses entirely on tactics.

It leaves you with many useful suggestions to improve the visual appeal of web interfaces, but not much around how to think like a designer.
