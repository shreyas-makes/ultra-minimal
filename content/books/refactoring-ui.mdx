A guide to UI design, written by the creators of Tailwind CSS. I was hoping for insight on the first-principles of great web design along with more tactical tips. 

I've been using this as a basis to design various responsive sites. 

Love how the book starts.

"Start with a feature, not a layout"

That's the title of the first section of the first chapter of this book. The authors explain that design is different from aesthetics. When you're developing a product like an app or a website, the most important thing is that it's functional. Decide what UI elements you need to satisfy that functionality first, then build your product around it. Google's home page contains little more than a single search box, but it's one of the most popular websites on the Internet.
