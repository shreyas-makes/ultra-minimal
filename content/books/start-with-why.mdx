The core concept of this book is important, but it could've been better explained in a 5 page blog post than in this 300 page book.

The idea that you should start with the "why" of your business before doing anything else is valuable. Unfortunately, the book spends hundreds of pages explaining to you why "starting with why" is the correct approach with the same examples.
