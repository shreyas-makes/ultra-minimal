I was excited at the concept of a book about generalists and why being a generalist is useful. Was expecting some insight on how to be a generalist effectively and some of the potential downsides.

This also continues from the line of thought provided by the book, 'Fuzzies and Techies' that cross-disciplinary pollination is useful for delivering unique ideas.

By specialising too early, we suffer from premature optimisation. The greatest of them link multiple fields, and don't optimise too early. MLK linked racism, capitalism, and militarism, Noam Chomsky linked language, power structure analysis, foreign affairs, journalism, economics.
