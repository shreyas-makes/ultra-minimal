Blitzscaling is the process of scaling a company by strategically prioritizing rapid growth above everything else. The largest software companies, including Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, etc. have successfully used this strategy to reach massive scale.

This book covers how to execute a blitzscaling strategy and mitigate its negative effects. The idea of scaling rapidly to dominate the market after hitting PMF gives me an adrenaline rush.
