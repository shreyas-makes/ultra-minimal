A short and highly readable book about how to hone your craft as an artist. Similar to "How to Do Good Work" by Paul Graham, but with more targeted advice and a more creative format.

Good insights on the importance of taking inspiration from other places, curating your taste, staying creative & consistent, and sharing your work with the world.
