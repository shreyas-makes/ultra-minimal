A controversial but thought-provoking book on how men should act toward women. Many interesting ideas, mixed with Deida's unjustified claims stated as if they were apparent fact.

I gave it a low rating because there are many arbitrary/unjustified ideas that are somewhat destructive to spread - but I actually do like how unconventional Deida's ideas are and he has many good tactical tips around maintaining attraction and sexual polarity in relationships.
