I recently watched The Recruit on Netflix. The show centers around Owen Hendricks, a young CIA lawyer whose first week on the job turns upside down when he discovers a threatening letter by a former asset Max Meladze. The asset plans to expose the agency unless she is exonerated of her previous crimes. The story takes off from there. There are dangers to splicing these two disparate genres comedy/thriller together as a mismash where the serious bits undermine the supposedly funny ones and vice versa. The show pulls this off quite well.

## Build School is live

One-month sprint on Framer is finally complete. The [Build School website](https://www.buildschool.net/) is finally live.

As a rebranding exercise, it did stretch my grey cells to push the limits and make it match with the right vibe: professionalism with a powerful vibrant punch. These were the only two keywords that were mentioned to me for the rebranding exercise, nothing else. This gave me enough room to creatively unfurl, and to finally arrive at a version that just 'clicked'.

The process reminded me of Christopher Nolan's approach while collaborating with composer Hans Zimmer for the Interstellar soundtrack.

Zimmer was just given two lines of a dialogue: "I'll come back" and "When?"[(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_%28soundtrack%29) instead of the entire film's plot. Zimmer then went on to write a four-minute piano and organ piece representing his idea of fatherhood, which became the heart of the film's score.

Sometimes, less is more. If you're curious about the earlier design, [you can view it here.](https://buildbystl.com/)

## Half-marathon!

I successfully completed my first half-marathon, which was a pleasant surprise since I had previously failed every time I aimed to finish 23 kilometers. This time, I decided to listen to a lengthy three-hour podcast episode while running. Halfway through, I experienced the mythical 'runner's high' and couldn't stop. I kept running until I reached the finish line.

## RES Launch

We're gearing up for a major launch at Noora Health, introducing a national health intervention for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and pulmonary diseases. My focus has been on developing a digital service that encourages patients to take positive health actions.

## Personal Website

Was able to update my personal website in such a way that it looks like the [blog](https://blog.shreyasprakash.com/) and the [website](https://shreyasprakash.com/) are from the same house. Pushed some pixels to keep it coherent.

## Podcasts

Was listening to Scott Galloway's Podcast episode on My First Million. These were the three quotes that struck me:

"So the key is finding, not finding your passion, but finding your talent and then committing to developing mastery. And if you can develop mastery in anything that has a 90 plus percent employment rate, which 98% of sectors enjoy, the economic accoutrements, the camaraderie, the prestige, the relevance, Just the sheer joy of mastery will make you passionate about whatever it is."

The most important metric for a SME is retention of employees. And a key factor in influencing the rention of employees is about being surrounded by friends. You are less likely to quit your job if you're around your friends.

"As long as there's four of them, they got my credit card. And the number one source of retention, I think the key to building a small business is retention because we find good people. You just don't want them to be with you a year or two years and go to Google because the switching costs are enormous. And if you find someone good, your job as an entrepreneur or the CEO is just to create an environment where they want to stick retention of employees, in my opinion, is just huge. And I find or I read a study, another study on this and it's at the number one source of retention and the number one lever for retention. People think it's compensation. People think it's culture. It's whether or not that person has a friend at work. If they have a friend at work, they look forward to going to work and they are less likely to leave. And so what I try and do, everybody interviews everybody when we hire people, but these kids, it's really inspiring."

I've been writing a comprehensive guide — 'Building Your First Rails App,' which is tailored for beginners eager to develop their first Ruby app. Currently, the manuscript spans over 3,000 words, and I'm only a quarter of the way through. Given that it may potentially reach 10,000 words, I'm pondering whether this content is best suited as an in-depth essay, a mini-book, or even a full book.

In writing this tutorial, I've adopted a first-principles approach, which sets it apart from many other tutorials that often target more experienced developers (especially the Ruby official docs). These can be overwhelming for novices encountering Ruby Rails code for the first time. My focus has been on clarity and simplicity, ensuring that I thoroughly explain even the most basic concepts that seasoned programmers might overlook.

## Falling in love with running again

I've been enjoying the runs in and around London. Have been tracking them actively on Strava, along with the occasional group runs through Strava communities. Prepping for a half-marathon in May.

## Virtual Bookshelf

I've always dreamt of having a virtual bookshelf of all my previous readings/book notes. My first attempt at creating this was through a [Notion second brain](https://shreyasprakash.gumroad.com/l/vFYWdf?layout=profile) five years back consisting of all my book notes back then. Recently, I came across this [react bookshelf component](https://x.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1778331522501947731) from Ahmad Majumdar on Twitter. I then forked this code and added this section on my website.

I now have a [dedicated 'books' page where I compile most of my book notes](/books). It's live, and it's still a work-in-progress. Yet to transfer all my book notes from Readwise.

## Niche Meetups

Have been participating in various niche interest-based meetups. To name a few, you have [Through the Glass Darkly](https://maggieappleton.com/gathering-structures) which is a round-house of philosophy, history, and social science nerds. The [Future of Code meetup](https://futureofcoding.org/) organised by Maggie Appleton diving deep into speculative futures through tech. Small Bets is featuring weekly online lectures centered around solopreneurship and the philosophy of 'small bets'. I'm also joining the No Code Network Meetup next week at Gilray House, London!

## Job Board for Tech Unicorns

Design engineering is having its renaissance right now. It’s the golden age of developers who also understand design. Companies have started to invest in craft. They are not viewing craft as a sacrifice on velocity (anymore). It’s now an investment in quality.

The old guard is being replaced by the new. You no longer have confusing roles and titles such as webmaster/UX unicorn/engineer.

Software artisan? Designeer? Builder? UX engineer? The lines between design and code are getting blurred. All roles merge into one—design engineer

These tech unicorns, as the name suggests, are not mythical fictional creatures. They are living, breathing human beings with design and engineering chops.

Rohit and I are building a [job board for design-engineers here](https://unicorn-jobs.vercel.app/). We are planning to launch this sometime soon once we have a solid marketing strategy in place.

## Founder/Hacker course

For the past six months, I've been learning Ruby on Rails in an on-and-off fashion. I've been following my own curriculum online, learning tips and tricks to eventually hack a SaaS all on my own. I've found great joy in expressing myself through internet projects and have collaborated with many great developers previously. This is my technical generalist curriculum so far:

- [Michael Hartl's Learn Enough to be Dangerous](https://www.railstutorial.org/) series (I've taken it step by step here, right from git, bash, text editors to then venture into Ruby, and then Ruby on Rails)

- Ryan Kulp's [Founder/Hacker course](https://www.founderhacker.com/). Completed two of his courses. The 24 Hour MVP as well as the Fundamentals 101 course. Ryan has previously sold various software startups and had picked up Rails coming from a non-technical background. He covers a lot of ground on hacking your way through code (even if you don't completely understand it)
