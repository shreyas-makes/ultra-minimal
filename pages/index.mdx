# Shreyas Prakash

I'm a designer turned entrepreneur, now a product manager.

I like creating things— writing, designing, coding, startups. Anything which is positive sum, and impactful. Some topics that currently interest me: ruby on rails, digital gardening, marathon running, interstitial journalling and AI code assistants.

## Some questions I'm pondering upon

- How might we make [1:1 mentorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem) scalable?
- How might we redesign cities to eradicate loneliness?
- How might we make [human-in-the-loop AI healthcare solutions](https://noorahealth.github.io/LLM-Project-doc-site/) accurate, reliable and scalable?
- What's the goldilocks zone of social-media consumption for teenagers? How much is too much?
- What would the tech-stack for a one-person billion dollar business look like?
