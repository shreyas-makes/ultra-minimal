I currently work as a Product Manager at [Noora Health](https://noorahealth.org/), leading the [Remote Engagement Service (RES)](https://blog.shreyasprakash.com/res/) and Special Projects. [RES](https://blog.shreyasprakash.com/res/) helps expectant and newly delivered mothers receive mobile health education at home. 

I have 7+ years of experience shipping products and services across femtech, healthcare, education, cleantech and SaaS. B2B, B2G2C and B2C. I like creating things (writing, designing, coding, startups). Startups are cool because they're positive sum & impactful.
